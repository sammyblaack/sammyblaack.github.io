The lantern was designed to receive Artnet messages over WiFi to change the colour of addressable LEDs.This project was built using ESP8266, and WS2812 LEDs, and included software development, and PCB design and assembly."}},"/posts":{"title":"Posts","data":{"":"Stay tuned for future posts."}},"/posts/lifxbridge":{"title":"LifxBridge","data":{"":"LifxBridge is a software tool that connects LIFX lights to a professional lighting console over the Artnet protocol.This software was developed using the Qt framework to allow cross-platform builds and makes use of the publicly documented LIFX LAN API to communicate with the lights.LifxBridge automatically polls and discovers LIFX lights on the network, allowing easy configuration and connection to a lighting console."}},"/posts/wireless_artnet_lighthouse":{"title":"Wireless Artnet Lighthouse","data":{"":"Designed and developed, both software and hardware for a fully wireless, battery-powered lighthouse to be used in the Counterpilot theatre production of Adrift.The lighthouse was built using ESP8266 running ESP-IDF to control 32 LED's each controlled individually with the use of shift registers. This required software-based PWM control to be able to dim each individual led.The lighthouse was designed to listen for Artnet messages over wifi and allowed configuration using my custom configurator software.The hardware was designed using KiCad and custom rigid and flex PCBs were produced for the final product."}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Tagged Posts","data":{"":""}}}
